# sensor-emulator-cli
## Motivation
At work, I ussualy works wih some sensor reading and shows them at a dashboard created by frontend team (I'm a IoT backend engineer to add some context). So, instead of using some sensor for testing, I create this emulator to emulate the behaviour on ideal condition.
